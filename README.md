# inform7-bugs: now retired

This repo provided an unofficial bug tracker for Inform 7 6M62. There is once again an [official Inform7 bug tracker](https://inform7.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/I7/issues), so there's no further need to report bugs in this project.

Please post interface bugs in the Inform 7 IDEs at these places:

- [Gnome](https://github.com/ptomato/gnome-inform7)
- [macOS](https://github.com/TobyLobster/Inform)
- [Windows](https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Inform7)

For bugs in the built-in extensions or extensions in the Public Library, please report them at [the Friends of Inform 7 Extensions repository](https://github.com/i7/extensions)
